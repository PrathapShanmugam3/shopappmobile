# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and progress for creating a Flutter scanner application. The application will use the device's camera to detect QR codes and barcodes and display the detected value in a popup.

## Features

- Real-time camera preview for scanning.
- Quick detection of QR codes and barcodes.
- A popup dialog to display the scanned code's value.

## Current Plan

1.  **Add `mobile_scanner` dependency:** Add the `mobile_scanner` package to `pubspec.yaml` to enable barcode scanning functionalities.
2.  **Create a scanner screen:** A new screen will be created to host the camera scanner.
3.  **Implement the scanner:** The `MobileScanner` widget will be used to display the camera feed and handle barcode detection.
4.  **Display the scanned value:** An `AlertDialog` will be shown to display the value of the detected barcode.
5.  **Update the main screen:** A button will be added to the main screen to navigate to the scanner screen.
